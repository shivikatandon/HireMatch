PROJECTS
Data-Driven Analysis of MHT-CET 2024 Engineering College Cutoffs
Tools & Technologies: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Regex), SQL, Power BI • Extracted real-time
cutoff data from https://fe2024.mahacet.org/ using Python web scraping (Requests,Beautiful Soup).
• Used Regex to transform unstructured cutoff strings into structured columns (College Name, Branch, Category, Cutoff
Score).
• Cleaned and transformed data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and performing type conversions.
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify top-performing colleges, high-demand branches, and
category-wise trends.
• Detected and addressed outliers, applied data visualization techniques (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)
using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
• Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore college-wise, region-wise, and category-wise cutoff
comparisons.
Weather Data Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project
• Designed and developed a 5-page interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing weather parameters (rainfall,
temperature, humidity, wind speed) across Telangana districts and mandals, with centralized navigation and
intuitive slicers.
• Applied Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, used DAX to compute weather KPIs, detect seasonal
trends, and highlight anomalies across regions.
• Created dynamic visualizations including bar, line, scatter, donut, heat maps, and tables to uncover actionable
insights from four-year weather data.
• Enabled climate-aware decision-making by identifying vulnerable regions and long-term weather shifts, supporting
planning in agriculture, health, and infrastructure.
Music Store Sales & Customer Insights Analysis
Tools & Technologies: MySQL (Joins, Subqueries, CTEs, Window Functions)
• Analyzed a normalized 11-table relational database consisting of (employee, customer, invoice, invoice_line, track,
playlist, playlist_track, album, artist, genre, and media_type)
• Wrote optimized SQL queries using joins ,group by ,havings , and window functions to identify sales and customer
trends.
• Gained expertise in relational design, foreign key relationships, and multi-table querying. •

Delivered clean, well-structured queries to support data-driven decision-making.
• Practiced query modularity and performance tuning for efficient analysis.
