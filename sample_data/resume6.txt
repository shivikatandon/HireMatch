ACADEMIC PROJECTS
SQL-Based Grocery Store Management System| LINK June 2025 - July 2025 • Created a database to manage
grocery store data like products, customers, suppliers, and orders.
• Wrote SQL queries to find useful information such as top-selling items and low stock products.
• Analyzed sales and customer activity to help improve store performance.
• Used joins and filters in SQL to connect different tables and get detailed reports.
• Helped store managers make better decisions using the data.
Used Bike Market Analysis – CredR.com | LINK February 2025 - April 2025 • Scraped used bike data from CredR.com
using Python (BeautifulSoup), extracting key features like Brand, Model, Year, Km, Cc, Owner, Location, Price, And Original
Price..
• Cleaned and structured the dataset using Pandas, handling missing values and converting data into analyzable
formats. • Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to study price trends based on brand, mileage, bike age, and
location. • Visualized insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn,showing brand-wise average prices and most
affordable models. • Delivered actionable insightsin a summary report with graphs and interactive visuals.
Deepfake Detection Using Machine Learning | LINK June 2024 - May 2025 • Developed a deepfake video
detection system using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. • Collected and used different types of fake
videos like face swap, lip sync, and voice change for training. • Built the project using Python, with a Flask-based web
interface for uploading and checking videos. • Measured accuracy of the model using metricslike accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score.
• Used LSTM to understand video frame sequences and detect changes that indicate fake content.
